We always miss coding contests now and then, it feels bad to miss a contest when your placement season is coming and you want to be prepared. We always wonder if there could be any website/app that shows all platform contests in one place so we could never miss a coding contest.

The 3 types of contests are split across 3 different routes (in 24 hours, live, future). Each of them is different color coded for better user understanding. Each contest has a link with which you can directly visit the specific programming site.

After selecting any of the routes (in the next 24 hours, live, or future) you will be getting contests for particular coding platforms.

In the contest cart, all the details about particular contests are available, such as the contest name, duration, start date, and end date, and there will be two buttons: visit the contest and add to calendar. If you click "Visit," you will be redirected to a particular contest page. If you click "add to calendar," you can add a reminder for the contest to your Google calendar.

The project CODING CONTESTS DETECTION main purpose is to help students with their hustle of remembering the coding contest timing of various coding platforms platforms. Using this website, the students can save their time by knowing about all the coding contests in one place. This project is meant to save the time of students who are busy with their schedules and they miss their codingcontests due to their ignorance of contest timings. We all know the importance of codingcontests when placement is near. This will help them a lot, and there will be fewer chances of missing any contest.
